# API.AI Ionic 2 App w/ Speech Recognition and Text to Speech

You will need an API.AI account with your own Client Access Token => mine should answer questions about the weather if you use mine.

You can text and use voice to ask questions. The response will be an alert with the answer. 

## Working On
- [ ] A more conversation based layout
- [ ] Returning voice questions with voice answers. I know HOW it should work but Angular 2 observables are messing with me.
